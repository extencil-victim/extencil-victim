## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, this is an account created specifically for exploiting vulnerabilities under the control of [@extencil](https://github.com/extencil). Let me explain further.

I am a cybersecurity researcher and to avoid compromising any real GitHub customers/users, I created this account to serve as the "VICTIM" for all my research. This means that if I discover or find a vulnerability on GitHub to report responsibly, only this account will be the target of my research.

For GitHub support, I am reachable at the email registered on my main account for any explanations.

You can also contact me at `extencil [at] proton [dot] thc [dot] org` for general questions.

Thank you.
